## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Key takeaways from this project center around building search and filter capabilities. In particular, how and when to clear state is a key consideration. This is also the first time I've attempted implmenting a light/dark mode. Actually pretty straightforward once you understand a coulple of core concepts. 

### Continued development

This project is pretty basic and I chose to follow the prescribed design. I would probably work on an improved visual look and feel to make the project more substantial. I would also enhance interative elements to improve UX.
